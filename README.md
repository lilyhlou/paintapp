App to draw on an image 

For COMP 401: Foundations of Programming, I coded an image editor using Java. The editor lets you hover over a part of the picture for its X and Y coordinates along with information about the color code at that coordinate. You can also clone that color to another section of the editor that lets you draw on the photo (which can be uploaded through a URL). When drawing, you can control the RGB values, brush size, and transparency of the paint. The person in the first picture is my professor.
